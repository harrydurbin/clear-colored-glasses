<p>The term optimism derives from the Latin optimum, meaning "best". Being optimistic, in the typical sense of the word,
  is defined as expecting the best possible outcome from any given situation. This is usually referred to in psychology
  as dispositional optimism. It thus reflects a belief that future conditions will work out for the best. For this reason,
  it is seen as a trait that fosters resilience in the face of stress. Dispositional optimism and pessimism can be
  assessed by asking people whether they expect future outcomes to be beneficial or negative. This app sets out to help
  users assess their self optimism levels for personal observation and improvement, to develop a more healthy, outlook over
  time. Many theories assume optimism can be learned and research supports a modest role of family-environment acting
  to affect optimism, neuroticism and pessimism.</p>
